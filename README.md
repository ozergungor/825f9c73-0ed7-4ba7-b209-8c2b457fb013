Implement two methods at `SeleniumExecutor` class from a `src/main/java/com/devskiller/selenium/SeleniumExecutor.java`, that should use a Selenium WebDriver to extract some information from a `src/test/resources/__files/index.html` page. You can assume that the page is already loaded by the driver. 

1. Extract content from the `<h1>` header at the `div` html node with a `.container` class
2. Click button `Click me!` and extract link URL from the newly created `<a>` element

# Warning
- Do not return hardcoded values!
